## Music Information System

Advanced Web Programming & Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with UML Project

## Overview

The Music Information System is a web-based application designed to provide detailed information about musical artists and their works.
It allows users to search for artists, explore their albums and songs, and view metadata such as nationality, language, number of listens, and relationships between artists and productions.

This project demonstrates the integration of web technologies, database management, and object-oriented design principles using UML.
